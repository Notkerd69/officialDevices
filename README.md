# hentaiOS Official Devices Database

## Swiggity Swooty, I am inside your walls

This is hentaiOS Official Devices database, it is a database, You can become an entry inside it. I hope you are not startled by the TOML file.

This repository has the following structure:

```Treeview
.
├── schema/
│   ├── *.jsonc
├── changelog/
│   ├── *.md
├── buildChangeMeta.toml
├── changelogData.toml
└── furData.toml
```

We suggest [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) to get the suggestions for changing the entry, or if you know what are you doing, use the schema in `schema/` folder, the configuration are pretty self-describing, though.
